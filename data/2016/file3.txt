Animal Disease Spread Modeling for Epidemiological and EconomicsPurposes: Learning from the 2015 Highly Pathogenic Avian InfluenzaOutbreakMelissa Schoenbaum, Kelly Patyk, Amy Delgado, Columb RigneyUSDA–APHIS–VS–STAS–CEAHFort Collins, ColoradoMelissa.Schoenbaum@aphis.usda.gov, Kelly.A.Patyk@aphis.usda.gov,Amy.H.Delgado@aphis.usda.gov, Columb.P.Rigney@aphis.usda.govABSTRACTSimulation modeling is a well-established and essential tool for epidemiologic investigations, including populationdisease dynamics and the evaluation of mechanisms for disease control. Agricultural economic models allow usersto go beyond disease impacts to explore the cost implications of animal disease. The United States Department ofAgriculture’s Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health uses a variety of modeling tools to answer critical questionsfor planning and policy. In addition to describing some of these modeling tools, this presentation also covers somelessons learned while supporting the 2015 avian influenza outbreak.ABOUT THE AUTHORSMelissa Schoenbaum is a biological scientist with the USDA–CEAH
