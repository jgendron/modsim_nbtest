An integral part of these operations is efficient material storage logistics. One of the largestchallenges in developing logistical plans for material storage in this environment is the evolving nature of materialneeds; as ships are built the type of material they require to progress dramatically changes. In this paper, weintroduce a simulation model which supports adaptive planning of material storage strategies. This tool utilizesdiscrete event simulation to adaptively plan warehouse storage layouts and parts turnover across the life of shipconstruction and overhaul. This tool allows NNS to accurately simulate the massive quantities of parts that arrive atthe shipyard every month, route the parts based on optimal paths, and develop efficient storage strategies which arecapable of growing and shrinking with program demand.ABOUT THE AUTHORSNick Drucker is a Modeling and Simulation Product Manager at Newport News Shipbuilding.
