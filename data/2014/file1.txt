The Office of the Secretary of Defense (andmany other Defense organizations) mandate the use of HSI, and analysis and acquisition efforts that apply HSIpractices are more likely to be successful (e.g., Pew et al., 2007).Our team is presently investigating best practices for applying such evaluation techniques to medical trainingsimulation systems as part of a larger effort focused on the U.S. Army. In this paper, we will share our generalizablebest practices that developers and project engineers should consider in their own system initiatives. We offer thesesuggestions in order to encourage fellow medical simulation researchers and developers to use similar analysis andreporting methodologies, which will ultimately enhance comparability and clarity across the military and medicalsimulation-based training community.ABOUT THE AUTHORSDr. Patricia Bockelman is a Human Systems Research Scientist at MESH Solutions, LLC, a DSCI® Company.
