The paper provides a five-year retrospective with an analysis of the papers published under the MODSIM Analytics and Decision-Making Track. It uses text analytics to investigate the content of the track with MODSIM papers from 2014 to 2018. After presenting a background of data science and current trends, the research question provides a foundation for data processing and analysis. The paper offers additional detail on the analytic techniques appropriate for unstructured text data followed by the specific results of these techniques. In this way, the paper not only provides measures of analytic content within MODSIM but also introduces readers to a look at the workflow underlying text analytics - a technique gaining more popularity since 2018. This paper closes with key findings that analytics tracks focused on contemporary issues in industry are value added to the MODSIM brand and these tracks will likely continue to attract papers and attendees.
